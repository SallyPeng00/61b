GITBUG ERROR REPORT

1. Type of operating system you are using to produce this error:

Mac OS



2. Version of the Java system you are using (java -version).


12


3. Subdirectory of your Git working directory to use as the current
   directory when compiling and running your program.

repo/proj0/signpost


4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.

Running Puzzle Test in the PuzzleGeneratorTests.



5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

The make forward connection function keeps running after all the squares are connected, and resets the entire model.

For example, if you run puzzleTest, the print statement at line 174 would print out all the models. At one point, all the squares are filled with correct sequence numbers. Yet the code continues to run and reset all seqNum to zero.

Also, for connectable, should there be a case when one square is numbered and the other is not? That should also make the two squares connectable, right?

Thank you!
