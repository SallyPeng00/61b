For AI, when my search depth is greater than 1 (i.e. more than the simple find
function), it would result in not being able to find the correct _lastFoundMove.
 Also, it would not stop after finding one _lastFoundMove, and result in Null 
Pointer for the myMove function where I call toString.


5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

See above.
